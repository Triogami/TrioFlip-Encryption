# TrioFlip-Encryption
A new basic encryption type that not secure. 
Made for fun for school.
**I don't reccomend encrypting anything with this.**


# How it works
It first splits each byte in half, then it flips both of them. Next it combines all of the bytes together then inverses each byte as seen below in this diagram.
